She has been fortunate to have the opportunity to play many fun, frisky women such as Mame Dennis, Dolly Levi, Adelaide, Truvy, Mother Superior, Vera Charles, Mrs. Paroo, and of course Aunt Eller. She has appeared in commercials and had a featured role in &quot;America's Most Wanted.&quot; What else is there to say but &quot;Life is a Banquet&quot; (Mame), and Sonja  certainly enjoys it! <a href="#top" class="back2top">Back to top</a></p>

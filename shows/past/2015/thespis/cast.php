                                <p>An acting troupe out for a wedding picnic is spotted ascending the slopes of sacred Olympus, greatly surprising the ancient Greek gods! The astonished gods, who have grown elderly, confess they feel much ignored of late. A deal is struck whereby the thespians will play the roles of the gods for a year, allowing the latter to go to Earth to find out why their worshippers are dwindling. While the gods are down below, the newly-appointed deputy-gods on Olympus have been encouraged to experiment with their new powers, destroying the calendar, ruining viniculture, and upsetting international relations! In short, the actors turn out to be comically inept rulers. Having seen the ensuing mayhem from down on Earth, the angry Gods return to Olympus, sending the actors back to Earth as &ldquo;eminent tragedians, whom no one ever goes to see.&rdquo;</p>

                         <div id="History" class="castlistSynopsis"  style="height:0px;">
                                       <p>First performed at the  Gaiety Theater in London in 1871, <i>Thespis</i> or <i>The Gods Grown Old </i>began the most successful collaboration in the history of musical  theater. William S. Gilbert,  successful playwright, and Arthur Sullivan, successful composer, joined their  remarkable talents to write the first of the fourteen light operas that were to  make their names inseparable forever</p>
                                       <p>But today <i>Thespis </i>remains an enigma. Although  revivals were planned by Gilbert, Sullivan and impresario Richard D&rsquo;Oyly-Carte,  none ever occurred, and sometime after 1879 almost the entire score was lost &ndash;  and remains lost to this day. The  two exceptions are the choral piece &ldquo;Climbing Over Rocky Mountain&rdquo; which later  was lifted bodily and placed into <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>, and the solo &ldquo;Little Maid of Arcadee&rdquo;  which was published as a popular drawing-room ballad of the day. A third exception, a ballet, was  unexpectedly discovered in the early 1990s, but there is no mention of it in  Gilbert&rsquo;s libretto, and where it might have been inserted remains a  mystery.</p>
                                       <p>So that Gilbert &amp;  Sullivan aficionados could have the opportunity of seeing what the opera might  have been like, in 1954 tenor James Montgomery &ndash; longtime artistic director of  Philadelphia&rsquo;s Savoy Company and founder of the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Players  of Philadelphia &ndash; commissioned his son, Bruce, to compose a new score for the  opera in the style of Sullivan, using the existing libretto. It is an interesting sidelight to note  that <i>Thespis</i> is a youthful work of both composers. Sullivan was twenty-nine; Montgomery was  twenty-eight. It was first produced  by the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Players of Philadelphia in 1971, in celebration of  the G &amp; S centennial. &ldquo;Monty&rdquo;  (as the composer was affectionately known) included the two original songs from <i>Thespis</i> in his version of the operetta. While others have attempted to  recreate <i>Thespis</i> by writing new music or interpolating melodies from the  other G&amp;S operettas, Bruce Montgomery&rsquo;s original score &ndash; so reminiscent of  Sullivan himself &ndash; has been the most widely produced and received the most  critical acclaim.</p>
                                       <p>After 1971, <i>Thespis </i>became a regular part of the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Player&rsquo;s  repertoire. It was also produced  and directed by Montgomery with the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s light opera  company, the Penn Singers, in the spring of 1992. The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan  Society of Chester County produced the show, again directed by Montgomery, in  January 2001 at West Chester University.</p>
                                       <p>When the Gilbert &amp;  Sullivan Players of Philadelphia was resurrected in 1989 to perform <em>Thespis </em>at the Basingstoke Festival held at West Chester University, the show was  presented by Ian Smith and his son, Neil Smith. Both these Englishmen would  later found the very successful G&amp;S International Festival in their homeland  which has run annually since 1994. The success of <i>Thespis </i>at the 1989  Basingstoke Festival resulted in an invitation by the Smiths to the composer,  Bruce Montgomery, to produce and direct <i>Thespis</i> at the 2000 International  G &amp; S Festival in Buxton England. The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Players of  Philadelphia was again revitalized for the express purpose of appearing in the  2000 Festival, where this rare opportunity to experience the international  premiere of <em>Thespis</em> was received with universal acclaim. J.W. Pepper will now publish and  distribute <i>Thespis </i>worldwide, with all royalties going to support the  Springboard Grants Program of the Bruce Montgomery Foundation for the  Arts.&nbsp; </p>

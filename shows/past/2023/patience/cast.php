                                          <p>All of the maidens in the village are besotted with Reginald Bunthorne, a moody and handsome poet, but he has eyes only for the simple milkmaid, Patience. The problem? Bunthorne's artistic ways are all just an act to attract women to him--he doesn't even like poetry! Besides, Patience is in love with her childhood sweetheart, who happens to be a real poet named Archibald Grosvenor, but feels she cannot marry him because he is just too perfect. In the meantime, the serious (and decidedly non-poetic) platoon of Heavy Dragoon Guards that were meant to marry the village maidens find themselves dismayed and perplexed by their sudden loss of prospects. One of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's most successful shows, Patience is a rollicking satire that pits the straight-laced ideals of the Victorian era against the passions and indulgences of the 1870s Aesthetic Movement, ridiculing each side of the spectrum.</p>

After 50 years on stage in G&amp;S productions, Martha has relinquished her stage roles to the next generations! Bittersweet for sure, but she happily stepped into new roles behind the scenes. Together with Robert Moore, she directed last year's <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i> for RVCO as well as <i>The Mikado</i> in 2017. And in 2019, she directed <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i> for the Ardensingers. For more than a decade she has been creating the RVCO G&amp;S playbills, researching and writing all the articles for your reading pleasure. With a solid foundation of first singing chorus in all the G&amp;S operas, Martha then stepped into the spotlight to perform all the principal contralto roles in the canon,including The Learned Judge and Major General Stanley! Martha joined the Savoy Company in 1972 for 10 party years, then joined RVCO in 1981 for both G&amp;S and Broadway-style shows, eventually performing with all the G&amp;S societies in the Delaware Valley. She's also performed in other musicals and plays in the region, including nearby Hedgerow Theatre. Working her way through the animal kingdom, Martha became president of each of five G&amp;S societies.

Jeff enjoys camping, the shore, Italian Food, red wine, reviving his love with singing and photography, and is most eager to challenge himself, after many years away, at the piano again.

Singing and dancing with this group is a pure joy! Favorite shows include <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>, <i>Guys and Dolls</i> (1984, 2004), <i>Plain and Fancy</i> (1986 onstage with my daughter, Kerri), <i>Mame</i> (2007, Cousin Fan), and <i>My Fair Lady</i> (2012, Lady Boxington). This being my third time in <i>Patience</i>, it just goes to show that you can be a lovesick maiden well into your more seasoned years! "Let the merry cymbals sound!"

Pinafore</i>.  She was so happy to end her prior several decades-long hiatus from theatre.  Much gratitude to Bob, Florrie, and Kathy for giving her this wonderful opportunity with this lovely and talented cast.   Sharon also sings baritone with Sweet Adelines/Philadelphia Freedom Chorus (women's barbershop). She previously sang with Northwestern University Singers, the Swarthmore College Chorus, and the Singing Moms. Tap was on her bucket list, so she takes tap and wants to get back to salsa and bachata lessons at Salsa in the Suburbs. Favorite roles: Sharon/By My Side (<i>Godspell</i>), Sylvia Barrett (<i>Up the Down Staircase</i>), and singing Handel's <i>Messiah</i> annually (and the never staged <i>Hoopla Barker</i>).  Off stage, Sharon is a physician who takes care of babies' hearts, and enjoys hiking, gardening, and dancing. She plays flute, some piano, and very little guitar. <a href="#top" class="back2top">Back to top</a></p>

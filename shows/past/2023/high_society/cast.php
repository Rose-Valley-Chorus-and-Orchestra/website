                                <p>High Society is a Jazz Age musical adapted for stage from the 1956 movie musical of the same name. It was based on Philip Barry's 1939 play and subsequent Hollywood hit comedy The Philadelphia Story, starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. The story involves high society hijinks surrounding the wedding of socialite Tracy Lord. As Tracy prepares for her day in the sun, her ex-husband shows up to throw a wrench in the works. Hilarity ensues when reporters show up to expose the prominent family's secrets. </p>

                                <p> The show features many Cole Porter favorites, including "Let's Misbehave", "True Love", "Well, Did You Evah!", and "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" performed by our spectacular cast of singers and our resident pit orchestra!</p>

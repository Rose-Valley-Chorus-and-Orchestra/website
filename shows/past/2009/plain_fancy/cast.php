                                          <p> Dan King and his girl, Ruth Winters, are lost in the heart of Amish Pennsylvania in search of Bird-in-Hand. Dan has inherited property there and has agreed to sell the land to Papa Yoder for a wedding gift to his daughter, Katie, and her intended, Ezra. When they finally arrive, preparations for the wedding are in full swing. Sophisticated Ruth marvels at their naivet√© but longs for New York. Hilda Miller, a spunky Amish maiden, falls for Dan and misinterprets his kind words as words of love. The Amish men are teasing Ezra about marrying Katie. His only retort is, "Why not?" But Ezra's brother Peter, banished from the community for fighting, has returned. He and Katie were childhood sweethearts, and the feelings are very much alive. Dan tries to intercede for the lovers, but stubborn Papa Yoder reminds him that he is a guest in a different way of life.</p>
                                        <p>Taunted by Ezra, Peter raises his hand against his own brother. Just as he does, the barn on Dan's property is struck by lightning and burns to the ground. Papa declares that Peter's evil actions are responsible and Peter is "shunned," even by a frightened and confused Katie.</p>
                                        <p>In true Amish tradition, the barn is rebuilt. Peter manages to get Katie alone, but to no avail. Ruth is having the same kind of luck in the Amish kitchens and retreats to her trusty bottle of Scotch. When Ezra asks what she's drinking, she covers up by answering "vegetable juice." Ezra requests a sample and in short order is completely drunk. He decides he's to have a bachelor fling at the Lancaster carnival and departs. Hilda finds out that Dan doesn't love her and also wants to see the outside world. At the carnival, Ezra gets into a brawl and is almost killed by a knife-wielding roustabout. But Peter has followed him. He steps in to break it up and returns his still sozzled brother to the wedding gathering. Ezra, too, is now disgraced, but Dan is successful in obtaining Papa's consent to a marriage between Katie and Peter with Dan's farm thrown in free as a wedding present. The experience has brought Dan and Ruth closer together as they return to New York. </p>

		<p class="bios"><a name="BOB ALLEN"></a><span class="person">Bob Allen</span> (<span class="role">Set Construction Chair</span>) joined the chorus in 1981 for <i>Ruddigore</i> and happily sang his part for several seasons before flubbing a line; now he operates backstage.  He has produced and/or stage-managed dozens of productions over the past 25 years.  He continues to be amazed at how the efforts of so many talented people, working independently throughout the region, come together to produce such delightful productions. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
               
          <p class="bios"><a name="SONJA ALLEN"></a><span class="person">Sonja Allen</span> (<span class="role">Costumes</span>) has appeared on stage and backstage with RVCO since 1981.  Sonja's on stage roles with RVCO include Mame (<i>Mame</i>), Dolly Levi (<i>Hello, Dolly!</i>), Adelaide and Gen. Cartwright (<i>Guys and Dolls</i>) and Mrs. Paroo (<i>The Music Man</i>).  Her roles with other local groups include the title role in Mame, Mother Superior (<i>Nunsense</i>), Claire and Truvy (<i>Steel Magnolias</i>), and <i>Side by Side by Sondheim</i>.  She has appeared in commercials and had a role in "America's Most Wanted."   Her MOST enjoyable activity is spending time with her grandchildren and teaching them by participation that "life is a banquet."  One granddaughter-a loyal RVCO audience member from age 1/1/2-is now living in Seattle and very involved in little theatre and school productions.  It works-start them early.  RVCO is a family-oriented group and it's great to share it with husband Bob and many close and dear friends. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
               
          <p class="bios"><a name="ALAN ALVAREZ"></a><span class="person">Alan Alvarez</span> (<span class="role">Isaac Miller</span>) has appeared in numerous RVCO productions, most recently as Claude Upson, in <i>Mame</i>, Gaston in <i>The Red Mill</i>, the Heavenly Friend in <i>Carousel</i>, Lord Battersby in <i>Me and My Girl</i>, and Big Jule in <i><i>Guys and Dolls</i></i>.  Previous major RVCO roles were Gangster Number 2 in <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>, Marcellus in <i>Music Man</i>, Vernon Hines in <i>The Pajama Game</i>, and Nathan Detroit in the 1984 <i><i>Guys and Dolls</i></i>.  Alan appeared as a non-union featured background artist (extra) in the movie, <i>Invincible</i>, starring Mark Wahlberg.  He also played the role of Lenny, a bartender, in the independent film, <i>Jack of Clubs</i>. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

          <p class="bios"><a name="CALVIN BRACKIN"></a><span class="person">Calvin Brackin</span> (<span class="role">Papa Yoder</span>) is pleased to be making his debut with RVOC, especially with Plain and Fancy.  Thirty years ago, he was Moses Zook in <i>Plain and Fancy</i> at Three Baker's Dinner Theatre and has always said that "theatre is wonderful, because no matter how old you are, there is always a role for you".  Here is living proof.  Cal is a retired teacher from the West Chester Area School District where he taught creative and performing arts in their program for gifted and also choral music at Starkweather Elementary.  He is currently on staff in OperaDelaware's education department, directs and performs locally, is vocal coach for the Delaware All State Theatre and has a private vocal studio in West Chester. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
               
		<p class="bios"><a name="JEANNE BRUNO"></a><span class="person">Jeanne Bruno</span> (<span class="role">Ruth Winters</span>) is a veteran performer of regional theater for many years.

Other appearances were at Players Club of Swarthmore as Felia in <i>Forum</i>, Agness in <i>I DO, I DO</i>, and Rosalie in <i>Carnival</i>.  In addition her credits include Irene Mulloy in <i>Hello Dolly!</i> at Three Little Bakers.  When not on stage, she has done costumes and choreography.  The best reward is a well timed laugh and the applause at curtain call. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

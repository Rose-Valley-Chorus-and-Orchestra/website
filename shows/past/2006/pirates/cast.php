                                <p>When Frederic was a youngster, his nursemaid, Ruth, was told to apprentice him to a pilot.  But, being hard of hearing, Ruth mistook the word and apprenticed him to a band of pirates.  To atone for her error, Ruth remained with Frederic as a maid-of-all-work.  Frederic loathed the trade to which he had been bound, but served dutifully.  As the curtain rises, we find Frederic celebrating his 21st birthday, which ends his indenture.  He is preparing to leave the band and devote himself to the extermination of piracy.</p>
                              <p>Ruth begs him to take her with him as his wife.  Having seen no other women, Frederic cannot compare her to others and consents to her wishes.  Just then, a group of young ladies, all wards of Major-General Stanley, appear on the scene.  Amazed by their beauty, Frederic renounces Ruth.  When the ladies refuse Frederic's invitation of love, Mabel steps forward.  The rest of the pirates appear, seize the ladies, and threaten immediate marriage.  The Major-General arrives and, having heard of the famous Pirates of Penzance, plays on their sympathy by claiming to be an orphan.  The pirates, being orphans themselves, never attack other orphans and let the Major-General go.</p>
                              <p>This lie troubles the Major-General's conscience and at the beginning of the second act he broods in his Gothic ruin.  He is comforted by his wards and Frederic's plan to lead a band of police against the pirates.</p>
                              <p>However, the rejected Ruth finds a loophole in Frederic's contract.  She and the Pirate King tell him that since he was born on February 29, he has not strictly reached his 21st birthday.  Frederic reluctantly, but dutifully, returns to the pirate band and tells them of the Major-General's lie.  The pirates seize the Major-General and a battle ensues between the pirates and the police who have come to the rescue.  The pirates initially overcome the police, but then yield in Queen Victoria's name.  Ruth reveals that the pirates are all noblemen who have gone wrong-they are pardoned and permitted to marry the Major-General's wards.</p>

<div class="bio">

<p class="bios"><b><a name="SONJA"></a>Sonja Allen <i>(Stage Manager)</i></b> has been with RVCO since 1981.  She has worked backstage for several shows as husband Bob's right hand stagehand.  She feels it is time for a "role reversal" and will have him as her right hand for this show.  Sonja has appeared on-stage in many roles. Her RVCO roles include Dolly Levi (Hello, Dolly!), Adelaide and Gen. Cartwright (Guys and Dolls) and Mrs. Paroo (The Music Man).  Roles with other local groups include the title role in Mame, Mother Superior (Nunsense), Claire and Truvy (Steel Magnolias), and Side by Side by Sondheim.  She has appeared in commercials and had a role in America's Most Wanted.  Her most enjoyable RVCO activity is working "in the sewing hole" on costumes with the "pick a little, sew a little ladies." <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="HELEN"></a>Helen J. Beldecos <i>(Chorus)</i></b> joined RVCO in 1985 and has performed regularly ever since.  Her roles include Lady Battersby in Me and My Girl, Shaindel in Fiddler on the Roof, Mae in The Pajama Game, Mrs. Rose in Hello, Dolly!, Fatima in The Desert Song, and Maud Dunlop in The Music Man.  Behind the scenes, Helen has been in charge of tickets and treasurer.  "RVC is a wonderful group of talented performers; it is a pleasure to be associated with them." <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="LINDAMARIE"></a>Linda Marie Bell <i>(Kate)</i></b>, a chemist by profession, is thrilled to be cast as Kate Stanley with RVCO.  Linda sings sacred music with The Choristers of Upper Dublin and began her adult life onstage with North Light Players as Marian Paroo in The Music Man.  A soprano with Savoy Company, she has performed in Gilbert and Sullivan's: Pirates of Penzance, Utopia Limited, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, Mikado, Sorcerer, Gondoliers, and Yeomen of the Guard.  With Old Academy Players, she sang in the musical variety shows: Broadway Memories and Broadway Memories-Revisited.  Linda has been cast again as a Bridesmaid in the upcoming production of Trial By Jury for The Gilbert and Sullivan Society of Chester County.  Linda is pleased to appear in this RVCO production with pirates and policemen, Kevin and Joel! <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="SHEILA"></a>Shelia Bell <i>(Chorus)</i></b> "I've enjoyed singing in the chorus for the G&S productions since Iolanthe in 1987 but I'm especially pleased to have Tom join me again on stage for this show!" <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="BRUCEB"></a>Bruce Bogdanoff <i>(Chorus)</i></b> made his stage debut with RVCO in Me & My Girl as the Pearly King and other ensemble roles.  A neurologist, he joined RVCO in 1989 as pianist for Mikado.  With Ohev Shalom Players, he played keyboard for Pippin and was Bobby in Company, Senex in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, General Bullmoose in Li'l Abner, and Albert Peterson in Bye Bye Birdie.  He performs with various chamber music groups and the RVCO Chamber Trio. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="ARNZA"></a>Arnza Chamberlain <i>(Chorus)</i></b> returns to RVCO for her second show.  No stranger to musical entertainment, she took to music at an early age.  Raised in North-Philadelphia, she started on the viola at six and played in an elementary school string quartet and the Phila. Children's Orchestra at seven.  Throughout high school and college, she sang in the choir and played in the orchestra-including the Philadelphia All-City Orchestra. She is the manager and artist developer of her four daughters' singing group "Min-US-ONE." <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="KEN"></a>Ken Clark <i>(Set Construction Chair)</i></b> was first listed under Costumes for Kiss Me, Kate in 1998.  After lugging costumes, installing grommets, and posing occasionally as a "Male Model", he explored other avenues and proceeded through Stage Crew to Set Construction Crew to Set Construction Chair which he did for Patience, Carousel, HMS Pinafore/Cox & Box, and The Red Mill.  He has also done bit parts on stage: a Policeman in Hello, Dolly!, a Suspicious Character in Guys and Dolls, and a Clergman in The Red Mill. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="LISA"></a>Lisa Cleek CLEEK <i>(Chorus)</i></b> is happy to be making her first appearance at RVCO this season, but is very familiar to the stage and with G&S in particular, having been active with The Savoy Company and Thespis, Etc. both onstage and backstage.  Pirates of Penzance is one of her favorite shows and she hopes everyone will enjoy watching it as much as she enjoyed being a part of it.  Lisa would like to thank her friends and family for coming out to support her in her theatrical endeavors. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="JENNIFERC"></a>Jennifer Cole <i>(Ruth)</i></b> appeared as Lady Jane in Patience.  Jennifer plays violin with the Bryn Athyn Orchestra and also teaches private violin and voice students, and is a soloist at the Bryn Athyn Cathedral.  She sang with the Cincinnati May Festival Chorus from 1983 to 1987, with the San Diego Master Chorale from 1993 to 1999 as a soloist, including Chichester Psalms and Liebeslieder Waltzes, and in the chorus for The Mikado with SDSU Opera Outreach in 1998.  Her recent credits with B-Act (Bryn Athyn Community Theater) include Dame Carruthers in Gilbert & Sullivan's The Yeomen of the Guard (spring 2004), and Fanny Cavendish in Kaufman and Ferber's The Royal Family (fall 2003), but Gilbert & Sullivan is her favorite.  Besides music and performing, her favorite thing is family: six sons, two daughters, two daughters-in-law, one son-in law, and five grandsons and one granddaughter.  She is very excited, because two more sons became engaged recently, so that means two more beautiful daughters-in-law, and eventually even more grandchildren! <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="BRUCEC"></a>Bruce Conley <i>(Chorus)</i></b> was Dirk in The Red Mill and David Bascombe in Carousel.  He is happy to return for this production.  A chorus member since 1988, he has also enjoyed performing minor roles in many past shows:  such as Brigadoon, The Yeomen of the Guard, Hello, Dolly!, and Die Fledermaus. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="THOMAS"></a>Thomas Dodds <i>(Chorus)</i></b> first jointed RVCO in the non-singing role of the Priest in The Yeomen of the Guard.  But he really enjoys singing, so he returned to our stage as a chorister in The Sorcerer, Die Fledermaus, Patience, and HMS Pinafore. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="WILLIAM"></a>William V. "PETE" Dorwart <i>(Music Engraver)</i></b>, a cellist in the orchestra, spent most of his professional career as a clinical chemist for Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Bryn Mawr Hospital.  As a retirement project, he has produced new editions of eleven of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.  His edition of The Merry Widow, which RVCO premiered in March 1999, has been used by the Metropolitan Opera for 26 performances over three different seasons.  He has completed new string parts for Aida in a joint project with Met and the Chicago Lyric Opera.  A new edition of Johann Strauss, Jr.'s Gypsy Baron was performed by the Main Line Opera Guild in 2005.  His State Fair by Victor Herbert, premiered this past March in the Lincoln Center in a performance by the Little Orchestra Society. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="MICHAEL"></a>Michael Dutka <i>(Sergeant of Police)</i></b> appeared as Dick Deadeye in Rose Valley's production of H.M.S. Pinafore last fall.  Beginning with Sergeant Meryll in a college production of The Yeomen of the Guard, he has appeared in numerous Gilbert & Sullivan roles, including Roderick in Ruddigore with the Gilbert & Sullivan Society of Chester Country, The Mikado with The Ardensingers and The Usher in Trial By Jury with The Savoy Company.  An open-minded chap, he has even played non-G&S parts, including The Commendatore in Don Giovanni, two Menotti roles - Mr. Gobineau in The Medium and Melchior in Amahl and the Night Visitors, Huckabee in The Fantasticks, and Emile in South Pacific.  Michael lives, sings, rides horses and writes dark fiction and fantasy in Doylestown, PA.  He wishes to thank his singing teacher, Richard Johnson, and his father, in memorium, for his constant encouragement and moral support. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="CAROL"></a>Carol Freed <i>(Music Director/Conductor)</i></b> started piano at the age of six and was first music director as a senior at Lower Merion High School.  Since then she has been music director/conductor for many local theater groups.  She joined RVCO in 1977 as accompanist and became music director and conductor with The New Moon production in 1985.  Her longevity with RVCO has now earned her the distinction of lifetime membership.  "What a privilege to lead such a wonderful and talented group of people, both actors and orchestra."  Off the podium, she sells real estate with Weichert Realtors and does vocal coaching.  "Thanks to my husband, Marvin, for supporting me, always." <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p class="bios"><b><a name="HELENE"></a>Helene Furlong <i>(Assistant Music Director/Isabel)</i></b> has assisted in the musical direction for all our shows starting with Ruddigore in 1990 up to the present production, including RVCO's Music in Schools traveling production of The Pirates of Penzance.  For RVCO, she has danced and played roles onstage, been in the chorus, played clarinet in the orchestra, worked stage crew, and called cues.  She assisted Dr. Adeline Bethany with the Cabrini College/Delaware County College Community Chorus' trip in 2004 and had the experience of a lifetime conducting the choir in Spain and Portugal.

Helene has a B.S. in Music Education from West Chester University and belongs to the Philadelphia alumnae chapter of Sigma Alpha Iota, an international women's music fraternity.  Helene would like to take this opportunity to remember Joanna McLaughlin, whose beautiful voice and vibrant, upbeat personality helped to make the RVCO special. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

                              <p>Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri, Venetian gondoliers, are told one of them is the heir to the throne of Barataria. Until it is determined which one is the new king, the brothers must rule together. Complicating matters the brothers have not only recently married young Venetian ladies, but they will soon meet the daughter of the Duke of Plaza Toro, to whom the unsuspecting future king was married in infancy. As the Grand Inquisitor seeks the truth from the young menâ€™s foster mother, everyone assembles in Barataria awaiting the answer. Who is the rightful king?  And will hearts be broken?</p>

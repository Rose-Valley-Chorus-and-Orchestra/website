          <h2>Show Synopsis</h2>
                    <div class="story">          
                     <p>The Tony Award-winning musical, <i>How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying</i>, follows the rise of J. Pierrepont Finch, who uses a handbook called 'How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying' to climb the corporate ladder from window washer to high-powered executive, tackling familiar but potent dangers such as the aggressively compliant "company man", the office party, backstabbing coworkers, caffeine addiction and of course, true love.</p>

                    <p>The standout score by Frank Loesser features such classics as the surreal and funny "Coffee Break", the rousing "Brotherhood of Man", and the melodious tongue-in-cheek ballad "I Believe In You", while the book by Burrows, Weinstock, and Gilbert, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1962.</p>

     <!--<h2>Show Synopsis</h2>

         <p>Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri, Venetian gondoliers, are told that one of them is the heir to the throne of Barataria. Until it is determined which one is the new king, the brothers must rule together. Complicating matters, the brothers have not only recently married young Venetian ladies, but they will soon meet the daughter of the Duke of Plaza Toro to whom the unsuspecting future king was married in infancy. As the Grand Inquisitor seeks the truth from the prince's foster mother, everyone assembles in Barataria awaiting the answer. Who is the rightful king?…and will hearts be mended or broken?</p> -->
